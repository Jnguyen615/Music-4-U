# Music-4-U 

## Abstract 
This project was originally based off of a static comp project from  Mod 2 at Turing School of Software and Design. The static comp was just a basic shell of html and css to recreate a design given to us. However, I have done the project before in being repeater of the mod so I decided to take the project a little futher by implementing actual data and displaying that data rather than hard coding it into the html. I started the project off with no dependencies but later decided that it would be a good idea to connect it to the dependencies I am used to using for projects. 

## Context
I am a a current student in Mod 2 out of 4 at Turing School of Software and Design. We had 5 days to complete the project and took roughly 13 hours.

## Collaborators
I did this solo my git hub is [Jen Nguyen's Github](https://github.com/Jnguyen615)

## Learning Goals 
- From project instructions 
  - Challenge to keep working with CSS and HTML 
  - Build something that respects the integrity of the original design
- Self Goals 
  - Build a data set to use for importing 
  - Display imported data on screen to practice more before working more with fetch API's 
  - Practice with proper importing and exporting of files 

  ## Technology Used 
  - Javascript ES6
  - Webpack
  - Github 

  ## Wins and Challenges
  - A win was being able to write the code to display all the of the data on the page on different cards. I needed more practice with it so I decided this project would be a great time to do so. 
  - Another win was implemening the webpack thanks to the Turing webpack starter kit. 
- A challenge was with the CSS on the top bar, I couldn't get the words to all line up on one line next to the icons no matter what I tried.
